/**
 * Which backends may RUN a hosted web_search, and which candidate rows each
 * can run (#2188 rule 2 for web-search: ∩ probed backend with an executor).
 *
 * A backend registers here only when BOTH hold:
 *  - an executor exists in this repository (src/web-search/executor.ts or
 *    anthropic-executor.ts today), and
 *  - its liveness probe passes. For the two shipped backends the probe IS
 *    auth presence — the ChatGPT forward path and the stored Anthropic OAuth
 *    path fail closed without a credential, so a live credential is the
 *    strongest pre-flight signal short of spending a search.
 *
 * Future backends (Gemini google_search, Grok web_search, Zen hosted search,
 * Exa-class vendors) stay OUT of this table until a live probe and an
 * executor land — the research and probe contracts are recorded in
 * devlog/_plan/260820_sidecar_selection_unification/002 and 031. Documenting
 * a tool is not the same as being able to run it.
